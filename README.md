# üî• Fireproof-256: Private & Compliant zk-Payroll System  
**Aleo & Aztec-powered payroll with full privacy, zk-Proofs, & multi-hop encryption.**  

Fireproof-256 is the **security and privacy framework** powering payroll for the **Proven National Workers (PNW) ecosystem**.  
It ensures that **Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW) & Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW)** receive **secure, private, and compliant payroll processing.**  

‚úÖ **Fully zk-Verified Payroll Execution**  
‚úÖ **Multi-Hop Transfers & Fake Noise for Privacy**  
‚úÖ **Automated Tax Compliance with Government API**  
‚úÖ **Seamless Cross-Chain Payroll Between Aleo & Aztec**

# üî• Fireproof-256 vs AEC-256  
**How Fireproof-256 Compares to AES-256 Encryption**  

---  
## üìå **Overview**  
Fireproof-256 is a **privacy-focused zk-proof encryption model** designed for **payroll, compliance, and financial transactions**.  
AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm for **data security and cryptographic protection**.  

| **Feature**              | **Fireproof-256** | **AES-256** |
|--------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Encryption Type**      | Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-STARKs) + Multi-Hop | Symmetric Block Cipher |
| **Bit Security Level**   | 256-bit zk-STARK proofs with Poseidon/MiMC hashing | 256-bit symmetric encryption |
| **Use Case**            | Payroll privacy, compliance tracking, multi-hop transfers | General-purpose data encryption |
| **Key Management**      | No key sharing (zk-Proof verification instead) | Requires key exchange |
| **Security Model**      | zk-Proofs, Merkle Proofs, Multi-Hop, Fake Noise | Block cipher-based encryption |
| **Anonymity**           | Fully anonymous payroll execution | Requires trusted parties to decrypt |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Ensures tax compliance without revealing payroll details | No built-in compliance tracking |
| **Performance**         | Optimized for blockchain zk-SNARK execution | Optimized for static data encryption |
| **Resistance to Attacks** | Immune to brute-force key guessing | Requires strong key management |
| **Data Visibility**      | Obfuscated transactions (only zk-verified entities can see relevant details) | Requires decryption for access |

## üîπ **How Fireproof-256 Uses 256-Bit Security**  

üî• **Fireproof-256 Still Uses 256-Bit Security ‚Äì But Differently**  
Unlike AES-256, which **encrypts data with a 256-bit symmetric key**, Fireproof-256 **uses 256-bit zk-STARK proofs for transaction verification and encryption obfuscation**.  

Fireproof-256 achieves **256-bit security** through:  
‚úÖ **Poseidon & MiMC 256-bit cryptographic hashing** for zk-STARK proofs.  
‚úÖ **256-bit Merkle Proofs** to verify payroll and tax records without revealing worker identities.  
‚úÖ **Multi-Hop Transaction Mixing with 256-bit entropy** to prevent tracing payments.  
‚úÖ **Fake Noise with 256-bit randomized payloads** to disrupt tracking attempts.  

**Result:** **Fireproof-256 achieves the same 256-bit security level as AES-256 but with enhanced privacy and compliance features.**

## üèõ **Government Compliance & Tax API**  

‚úî **Tax payments are zk-Proofed & verified before payroll execution**  
‚úî **Employers must maintain compliance to continue payroll processing**  
‚úî **Government audit access is limited to tax logs, preserving worker privacy**  

Fireproof-256 ensures **governments can audit employer tax records** **without seeing individual worker salaries.**  

---  

## üîó **Cross-Chain Payroll Execution (Aleo ‚Üî Aztec)**  

‚úî **Payroll funds can move between Aleo & Aztec seamlessly**  
‚úî **zk-STARK verification ensures transfers are valid**  
‚úî **SubDAO balances remain synced across both networks**  

Workers can **switch between AleoUSDC & CircleUSDC payroll at any time** while ensuring **zk-Proofed compliance.**
