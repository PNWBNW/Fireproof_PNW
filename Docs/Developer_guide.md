# Fireproof-256 Developer Guide  
**Private & Compliant zk-Payroll for Aleo & Aztec Networks**

---
##  **Getting Started**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
cd PNW-MVP

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Aleo & Aztec CLI tools installed:

npm install -g noir-cli

Set up Aleo & Aztec wallet access:

export ALEO_WALLET="your_aleo_private_key"
export AZTEC_WALLET="your_aztec_private_key"


---

 Deploying Fireproof-256

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Contracts

Run the deployment script:

./scripts/deploy_contracts.sh

This will:
 Deploy Payroll Contracts (pncw_payroll, pniw_payroll)
 Deploy Fireproof-256 zk-SNARKs (fireproof_crypto, fireproof_obfuscation)
 Deploy Compliance Contracts (process_tax_compliance, government_api)
 Deploy Merkle Proof Validation (merkle_helper)


---

 Testing Fireproof-256

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run Fireproof Security Tests

./scripts/test_fireproof.sh

Verifies:
‚úî zk-Proofs for Payroll Execution
‚úî Multi-Hop & Fake Noise Obfuscation
‚úî Merkle Payroll Proof Integrity

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Payroll Processing Tests

./scripts/test_payroll.sh

Verifies:
‚úî Payroll Execution for PNcW & PNiW
‚úî Worker Identity Validation (ZPass & ANS)
‚úî Employer Compliance Before Payroll Processing

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Compliance & Tax Tests

./scripts/test_compliance.sh

Verifies:
‚úî Employer Tax zk-Proof Compliance
‚úî Government API Privacy & Auditing
‚úî Merkle Proof Storage for Payroll History


---

 Smart Contract Overview


---

 Executing Payroll

Once all tests pass, execute payroll:

noir run batch_payroll_executor.noir

This will:
 Batch Payroll Execution for PNcW & PNiW Workers
 zk-Proof Validate Worker Identities & Tax Compliance
 Use Multi-Hop & Fake Noise to Obfuscate Transactions
 Merkle-Proof Payroll History for Future Audits


---

 Cross-Chain Payroll (Aleo ‚Üî Aztec)

Transferring Payroll from Aleo to Aztec

./scripts/convert_aleo_to_aztec.sh

 zk-Proof Ensures Payroll Was Verified Before Transfer
 Payroll Funds Are Converted from AleoUSDC to CircleUSDC
 Worker Data Remains Private During Cross-Chain Transfer


---

 Compliance & Government API Integration

Employer Compliance Enforcement

Employers must be tax compliant before payroll processing.
To check compliance:

aleo execute process_tax_compliance.leo --function check_compliance --args EMPLOYER_ID

To pay taxes:

aleo execute process_tax_compliance.leo --function pay_taxes --args EMPLOYER_ID AMOUNT

Payroll is automatically blocked for non-compliant employers.


---

 zk-Proofs & Fireproof-256 Encryption

zk-Proof Implementation

Payroll zk-Proofs: Verifies payroll execution before payment.

Multi-Hop Encryption: Prevents tracking of payroll transactions.

Fake Noise Transactions: Adds decoy transactions for privacy.


Merkle Storage

Payroll history is stored in Merkle proofs.

Government can audit compliance without exposing payroll details.



---

 Updating Fireproof-256

To update the contracts:

git pull origin main
./scripts/deploy_contracts.sh


---
