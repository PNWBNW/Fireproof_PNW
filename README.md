 zk-Proofs & Fireproof-256 Encryption

zk-Proof Mechanisms

Payroll zk-Proofs: Verifies worker eligibility before payment.

Multi-Hop Encryption: Hides payroll destinations.

Fake Noise Transactions: Prevents tracking of real payroll flows.



---

 Government Compliance & Tax API

Government API Enforcement

âœ” Tax payments are zk-Proofed & verified before payroll execution
âœ” Employers must maintain compliance to continue payroll processing
âœ” Government audit access is limited to tax logs, preserving worker privacy


---

 Cross-Chain Payroll Execution (Aleo â†” Aztec)

âœ” Payroll funds can move between Aleo & Aztec seamlessly
âœ” zk-SNARK verification ensures transfers are valid
âœ” SubDAO balances remain synced across both networks
