# üî• Fireproof-256: Private & Compliant zk-Payroll System  
**Aleo & Aztec-powered payroll with full privacy, zk-Proofs, & multi-hop encryption.**  

Fireproof-256 is the **security and privacy framework** powering payroll for the **Proven National Workers (PNW) ecosystem**.  
It ensures that **Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW) & Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW)** receive **secure, private, and compliant payroll processing.**  

‚úÖ **Fully zk-Verified Payroll Execution**  
‚úÖ **Multi-Hop Transfers & Fake Noise for Privacy**  
‚úÖ **Automated Tax Compliance with Government API**  
‚úÖ **Seamless Cross-Chain Payroll Between Aleo & Aztec**

## üîê **zk-Proofs & Fireproof-256 Encryption**  

Fireproof-256 uses advanced cryptographic methods to **secure payroll transactions** while ensuring **workers & employers remain compliant.**  

| **Security Feature**            | **How It Works** |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Payroll zk-Proofs**          | Verifies worker eligibility before payment |
| **Multi-Hop Encryption**       | Hides payroll destinations to prevent tracking |
| **Fake Noise Transactions**    | Generates decoy transactions to protect privacy |
| **One-Time Shuffling**         | Randomizes transaction order to prevent patterns |
| **Merkle-Proof Tax Records**   | Stores immutable payroll history for compliance |

## üèõ **Government Compliance & Tax API**  

‚úî **Tax payments are zk-Proofed & verified before payroll execution**  
‚úî **Employers must maintain compliance to continue payroll processing**  
‚úî **Government audit access is limited to tax logs, preserving worker privacy**  

Fireproof-256 ensures **governments can audit employer tax records** **without seeing individual worker salaries.**  

---  

## üîó **Cross-Chain Payroll Execution (Aleo ‚Üî Aztec)**  

‚úî **Payroll funds can move between Aleo & Aztec seamlessly**  
‚úî **zk-SNARK verification ensures transfers are valid**  
‚úî **SubDAO balances remain synced across both networks**  

Workers can **switch between AleoUSDC & CircleUSDC payroll at any time** while ensuring **zk-Proofed compliance.**
